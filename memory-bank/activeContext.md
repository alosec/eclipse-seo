# Active Context: Current Project State

## Current Work Focus
Website foundation is complete with all core infrastructure implemented. Focus has shifted to content population and SEO optimization.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ **Base Layout Implementation**: Complete header/navigation system with responsive mobile sidebar
- ✅ **Theme System**: Three-theme implementation (light, dark, purple eclipse) with CSS custom properties
- ✅ **Page Structure**: All six content pages scaffolded with proper routing
- ✅ **Eclipse Animation**: CSS keyframe animation for homepage hero section
- ✅ **Design System**: Complete design token implementation in Layout.astro

## Next Steps
1. **Content Population**: Pages currently have placeholder structure but need actual eclipse content
2. **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags are basic, need detailed descriptions and structured data
3. **Performance Review**: Audit Core Web Vitals and optimize further
4. **Accessibility**: Review for WCAG compliance and screen reader support

## Active Decisions
- **Content Strategy**: Prioritizing safety information visibility across all pages
- **SEO Approach**: Using Astro's static generation for optimal search indexing
- **Theme Choice**: Purple eclipse theme provides unique visual identity
- **Mobile Experience**: Half-screen sidebar provides better UX than full-screen overlay

## Current File Status
- `Layout.astro`: Complete with all theming and navigation
- `index.astro`: Complete homepage with hero, features, and CTA sections
- Content pages (`types.astro`, `safety.astro`, etc.): Scaffolded but need content
- `design.md`: Complete design system documentation

## Immediate Considerations
- Content pages need actual eclipse information and imagery
- SEO meta descriptions should be unique per page
- Consider adding structured data markup for better search results
- Theme switcher UI not yet implemented (themes exist but no user control)
